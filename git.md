## Using Git for Version Control

If you choose Visual Studio Code as your code editor, you will see a Source Control tab on the left sidebar, which is a GUI for Git operations. We still recommend you learn how to use Git commands in command line environments.

> **Note**: before you do your first git commit, you will need to configure git with your user information in your _Docker Container_. Use the following commands to do this:

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@seas.upenn.edu"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

There are several Git commands that you will need to use in this course. When executing Git commands, the terminalâ€™s current working directory should be inside your GitHub repo. Please read the linked guides for each command below:

- [git status](https://github.com/git-guides/git-status): shows which files have been modified and which files have been staged.
- git log: shows the commit history. Press `q` to exit.
- [git add](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add): adds files to the staging area.
- [git add -u](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add): looks for files that were previously part of the repository, and have been updated, and adds these to the staging area.
- [git commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit): creates a "checkpoint" of the changes from the files that have been `git add`'d.
- [git push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push): pushes local changes to the remote repository in GitHub.

If you need to undo an operations or changes you can use `git reset`, `git restore`, and `git revert`. The documentations linked above contains information on how to use these commands. Read them carefully to avoid losing your work.
